  # Digital Assets and Data Governance Framework
## 1-Digital Assets Inventory & Ownership
* **Project Name**: Atelier Enchante. * Ownership: 100% Intellectual Property Owned by Developer.
* **Tech Stack**:
* **Logic**: .NET Core, Node.Js, Python.
* **Data Warehouse**: Hybrid Architecture based on (NoSQL via ##MongoDB) for unstructured data & (SQL Server) for structured data.
* ** Assets Description**: A high-precision personla platform integrating AI agent and secure content management.

## 2-Data Classification & Security Matrix
* **This section follows ##SDAIA/NDMO classification levels to ensure compliance.

Data Owner | Classification | Structure       | Description                         | Data Asset
Admin      | Public         | Structured      | UserName/Public Profile             | Account Identity
Admin      | Top Secret     | Structured      | Email & Encrypted Passwords         | Credentials
Admin      | Secret         | Unstructured    | User Interactions with the AI Agent | AI Conversations
Admin      | Public         | Semi-Structured | Articles, Blogs, Designs            | Workshop Content

## 3-Data Lifecycle & Engineering Governance
* **Data Lifecycle**: We manage data from Ingestion --> Classification --> Encrypted 
Storage --> Authorized Usage --> Secure Deletion.
* **Maintenance**: Regular data cleansing and integrity checks to ensure Data Quality.
* **Transparency**: Useres are informed of data collection purposes via a clear Privacy Notes, adhering to the Right to be informed.

## 4-Risk Management & Comliance
* **Privacy by Design**: Implementing Encryption at rest and in transit for "Top Secret" assets.
* **Access Control**: Strict Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) where Admin (Owner) is the Sole Authority.
* **Risk Mitigation**: Implementing hashing algorithms (e.g., BCrypt) for Passwords to ensure even the database administrator cannot view raw credentials.
