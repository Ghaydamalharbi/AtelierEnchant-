**Where logic meets magic**
*Engineered with wonder*

## Overview
> An integrated technology platform that combines software innovation, data engineering, and national governance standards.

This project is my engineering laboratory for building advanced (full-stack) web solutions that adopt the latest technologies in the Saudi market and the directives of the Saudi Data & Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA).

## Strategic Planning and Governance
We build reliable and sustainable systems:

1- **Methodology:** Adopting the **Agile (Scrum)** methodology to ensure development flexibility and output quality.

2- **Data Governance:** Adhering to the standards of the **Nudhi'a Initiative (NUDI)** of **SDAIA** to ensure data quality and governance.

3-  **Engineering Lifecycle:** Engineering planning that begins with requirements analysis (UI/UX Design) and extends to technical architecture.

##  The Tech Stack
The most in-demand and powerful languages ​​in the software development market were selected:

1- **Backend Core:** Based on `.NET Core (C#)` to ensure enterprise-level security and professionalism.

2- **AI Engine:** A Python AI engine for building Persona AI and processing natural language.

3- **Real-time Logic:** Using `Node.js` for fast response times and real-time operations.

4- **Frontend Engineering:** Building interfaces using `HTML5`, `CSS3`, and `JavaScript` with a focus on coding efficiency.

##  Database Schema
We employ a **Hybrid Schema** system for intelligent data management:

1- **Relational Layer:** (SQL Server/PostgreSQL) for core data management and governance.

2- **NoSQL Layer:** (Redis) to accelerate access to recurring data.

3- **Vector Store:** to store AI-specific vectors, ensuring the accuracy of intelligent agent responses.
